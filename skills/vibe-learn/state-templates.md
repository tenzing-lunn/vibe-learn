# Local state templates

Create only these three files in the chosen project's `.vibe-notes/`, plus
`vibe-journal.md` beside that folder (the project root) after the first
Implementation report. Use the directory selected by SKILL.md.
Replace bracketed values with actual evidence or “Not specified.” Keep the status
lines unformatted and near the top; the restoration hook reads `Learning mode`.
Do not replace existing state with a fresh template.

As learning occurs, add a `## Topic` with concise bullets under Introduced,
Demonstrated understanding, and Needs reinforcement. Record reasoning evidence,
not quotations of a whole exchange. Product preferences establish requirements;
they aren't evidence of engineering understanding. Keep learner-proposed reasoning
distinct from concepts the agent explained. Consolidate repeated entries. Keep each
topic independently readable so it can be loaded without the whole file.
While waiting on a checkpoint, keep a short `## Pending decision` section
with the proposed approach and what reply is awaited. Remove it once resolved.
Include the checkpoint's decision name and stage: awaiting reasoning, choice
confirmation, or implementation approval. Record confirmed choices in the map
without claiming they are implemented. Keep any proposed coding scope explicit.
Confirmation covers only the proposal presented. Don't append unmentioned fields,
behaviors, rejected alternatives, or reasons to the chosen design. Mark unresolved
details unknown and the agent's suggestions proposed; never attribute them to the learner.

## project-map.md

```markdown
# Project Map

## Purpose
[What this software does.]

## Requirements
[User needs and constraints. These do not automatically settle technical choices.]

## Components
[Components, responsibilities, and supporting file paths.]

## Main Flow
[Compact text diagram with labeled arrows. Mark unknowns and distinguish proposed,
chosen, and implemented components. Reflect the learner's model refined together,
or verified existing code; don't fill missing relationships with assumed designs.]

## Data and Trust Boundaries
[Storage, ownership, auth, external services; unknown when unverified.]

## Build and Deployment
[Commands and configuration paths verified in the repository.]

## Unknowns
[Unresolved technical choices and what needs inspection, including relevant stack,
storage location/model, data structures, interfaces, and deployment choices.]
```

## vibe-journal.md

```markdown
# [Project name] Journal

A plain-language manual of what we've built, written with the words you've learned.

## Big Picture
[What the software does and its main parts, in a few sentences.]

## Components
[Each part: what it's responsible for, where it lives, what it talks to.]

## Key Flows
[Step-by-step walk-throughs of the important paths, e.g. "When a user saves a note…".]

## Details
[Mechanisms worth remembering, linked to the concepts behind them.]
```

Write the journal for the learner, not for the agent: use vocabulary they've been
taught or demonstrated, define anything new in a phrase, and keep an analogy where
one helped. Describe only implemented code, not plans; plans stay in project-map.md.
Revise sections in place so it reads as a current manual, not a changelog.
